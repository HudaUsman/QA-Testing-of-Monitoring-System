QA Validation of Temperature Monitoring System

This project demonstrates manual and automated QA testing of a simulated temperature monitoring system using Software-in-the-Loop testing.

Features:
- Manual test cases and defect documentation
- Python-based automation using pytest
- Logging for debugging and RCA
- Boundary and negative testing

Tools Used:
- Python
- VS Code
- Pytest
- Git

Note:
Hardware behavior is simulated due to limited access, following SIL testing practices.
